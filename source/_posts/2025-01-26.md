##  My life at school  ##
I had a home work in English to do for Monday and I needed to tell how I am sporty or artistic .

I explained that I am sporty because I can skate and snowboard very well. I can also play ultimate frisbee quite well. I can do rock climbing very well and I can play tennis a little. However, I can' t play football (and Ireally don't want to) and I can't surf at all.

In addition, I am a bit artistic because I can draw quite well and I can paint a little.

I don't really havbe musical talent. I can play the piano a little but I can 't dance and I also can't sing at all .
At the piano I can play Happy Birthday .
I can 't play the guitar at all and I never played the trumpet.
